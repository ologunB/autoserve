## Getting Started
To safely start off your new flutter application while basing it off this project:
- `git clone git@github.com:mastersam07/flutter-starter-kit.git myapp` this is private though
- Then open the folder inside **Android Studio** (Sorry `vscode` guys).
- Using **Android Studio**, update the `namespace` of your project. 
- You're good to go
- Go under `lib > utils` folder and update your `constants` and `styles` file accordingly.
- You can even create an `env.dart` file inside there to store your *secret keys* such as *api keys* while testing. This file will not be saved in git for privacy concerns

### How to rename to your namespace (technically, to your appId)
Say, your new `appId` is meant to be `example.company.myapp`, here's how to go about it:
- Ensure **Android Studio** has finished indexing your project. **VERY IMPORTANT**
- Making sure you're in the **Project Viewer* mode, expand on the **starterkit_android** to its entirety
- As you can see, the current `nammespace` is set to `space.acelords.starterkit`
- Right-click on `space`, select `refactor`>`rename` and rename to your desired name, e.g. `example`
- Select **Do Refactor** on all files presented at the terminal.
- Repeat the same steps for the other parts of the `namespace`, i.e. `acelords` => `example` and `starterkit` => `myapp`
- Confirm the namespace changing in `AppManifest` and all `build,gradle` files.
- You're good to proceed building your app.
